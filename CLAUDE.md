# Test Driven Development for Auto Insurance API

## Project Overview

This is a backend API application for Auto Insurance services following strict Test Driven Development (TDD) practices with comprehensive testing coverage across API, contract, performance, and functional domains.

## TDD Methodology: Red-Green-Blue Cycle

### ðŸ”´ Red Phase - Write Failing Tests
Write tests that define the desired behavior before any implementation code exists. Tests should fail initially, confirming they're testing something meaningful.

### ðŸŸ¢ Green Phase - Make Tests Pass
Write the minimum code necessary to make the failing tests pass. Focus on functionality, not optimization or elegance.

### ðŸ”µ Blue Phase - Refactor
Improve code quality while keeping all tests green. Optimize performance, remove duplication, and enhance readability.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. API Testing
- **Endpoint Coverage**: Test all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- **Request/Response Validation**: Verify headers, status codes, and payload structures
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Test security layers and access controls
- **Error Handling**: Validate error responses and status codes

### 2. Contract Testing
- **Consumer-Driven Contracts**: Define and validate API contracts between services
- **Schema Validation**: Ensure request/response formats match specifications
- **Versioning**: Test backward compatibility and version management
- **Documentation Sync**: Keep API documentation aligned with actual behavior

### 3. Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Measure system behavior under expected load
- **Stress Testing**: Identify breaking points and system limits
- **Response Time**: Monitor and optimize API response times
- **Resource Utilization**: Track memory, CPU, and database performance

### 4. Functional Testing
- **Business Logic**: Validate insurance calculation algorithms
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure accurate data processing and storage
- **Workflow Testing**: Test complete insurance processes (quotes, policies, claims)
- **Integration Testing**: Verify third-party service integrations

## Auto Insurance API Domains

### Core Domains
1. **Quote Management**
   - Vehicle information processing
   - Driver profile evaluation
   - Risk assessment calculations
   - Premium calculations

2. **Policy Management**
   - Policy creation and updates
   - Coverage modifications
   - Renewal processing
   - Cancellation handling

3. **Claims Processing**
   - Claim submission
   - Document management
   - Adjuster assignment
   - Settlement calculations

4. **Customer Management**
   - Profile management
   - Document verification
   - Payment processing
   - Communication preferences

## TDD Workflow Guidelines

### Red Phase Guidelines
```
1. Start with the test file
2. Define clear test descriptions
3. Write assertions for expected behavior
4. Run tests to confirm they fail
5. Commit the failing test
```

### Green Phase Guidelines
```
1. Write minimal implementation code
2. Focus only on passing the current test
3. Don't anticipate future requirements
4. Run tests frequently
5. Commit once tests pass
```

### Blue Phase Guidelines
```
1. Identify code smells
2. Extract common patterns
3. Improve naming and structure
4. Optimize performance if needed
5. Ensure all tests remain green
6. Commit refactored code
```

## Testing Tools & Frameworks

### Recommended Stack
- **Unit Testing**: Jest/Mocha for JavaScript, pytest for Python, JUnit for Java
- **API Testing**: Supertest, Postman/Newman, REST Assured
- **Contract Testing**: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract
- **Performance Testing**: k6, JMeter, Gatling
- **Mocking**: Sinon, WireMock, MockServer

## Test Organization

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Unit tests for individual functions
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Integration tests for API endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ contract/       # Contract tests for API agreements
â”œâ”€â”€ performance/    # Performance and load tests
â”œâ”€â”€ functional/     # End-to-end business scenarios
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/       # Test data and mocks
```

## Best Practices

### Test Naming Convention
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow pattern: `should_[expectedBehavior]_when_[condition]`
- Group related tests in describe blocks

### Test Data Management
- Use fixtures for consistent test data
- Implement data factories for dynamic test data
- Clean up test data after each test run
- Avoid hardcoded values in tests

### Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every commit
- Separate test suites by execution time
- Fail fast on critical test failures
- Generate coverage reports

## Code Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints covered
- **Contract Tests**: All external integrations covered
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for premium calculations, claims processing
