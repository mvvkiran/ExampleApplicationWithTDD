# Contract Testing Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the contract testing setup for the Auto Insurance API using Pact.io.

## Consumer Contracts Generated

### Risk Assessment Service Contract
- **Consumer**: auto-insurance-api
- **Provider**: risk-assessment-service
- **Interactions**: Risk score calculation for different driver profiles
- **Scenarios**: Young driver (high risk), experienced driver (low risk), validation errors

### Credit Check Service Contract  
- **Consumer**: auto-insurance-api
- **Provider**: credit-check-service
- **Interactions**: Credit score retrieval for premium discounts
- **Scenarios**: Excellent credit, fair credit, unauthorized access, invalid SSN

## TDD Workflow for Contracts

### RED Phase (Define Contracts)
1. Write consumer tests that define expected provider behavior
2. Tests initially fail as provider doesn't exist or doesn't match expectations
3. Generate Pact JSON files that describe the contracts

### GREEN Phase (Implement Providers)
1. Implement provider APIs to satisfy contract requirements
2. Run provider tests to verify contract compliance
3. Ensure all contract interactions pass verification

### BLUE Phase (Refactor and Evolve)
1. Refactor provider implementations while maintaining contract compliance
2. Evolve contracts by adding new interactions
3. Use contract versioning to manage breaking changes

## Running Contract Tests

```bash
# Run only consumer tests to generate contracts
mvn test -Dtest="**/*ConsumerTest"

# Run full contract test suite
mvn test -Pcontract-tests

# Verify provider compliance (requires running provider)
mvn pact:verify
```

## Contract Evolution

- **Adding new interactions**: Add to consumer tests, regenerate contracts
- **Modifying existing contracts**: Use contract versioning and provider branches
- **Breaking changes**: Coordinate with provider team using Pact Broker

## Best Practices

1. Keep contracts focused on actual usage scenarios
2. Use realistic test data that matches production patterns
3. Version contracts appropriately for breaking changes
4. Integrate contract tests into CI/CD pipeline
5. Use Pact Broker for team collaboration and contract sharing
